    "value": "proposed method with two versions of the JLF approach, one using an affine registered library(linear) and another using a non-linear registered library. It is worth to note the proposed method uses only linearly registered library(i.e. no non-linear registration was used). As can be noticed the proposed method was far superior to both versions.\n\nTable 6: Proposed method dice results compared to the results of two versions of JLF method.\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td>Method</td>\n<td>All labels</td>\n<td>Cortical labels</td>\n<td>Noncortical labels</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>vol2Brain</td>\n<td>0.8262±0.0257</td>\n<td>0.7996±0.0347</td>\n<td>0.8969±0.0157</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>JLF(linear)</td>\n<td>0.7369±0.0292</td>\n<td>0.7016±0.0337</td>\n<td>0.8305±0.0241</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>JLF(non-linear)</td>\n<td>0.7591±0.0252</td>\n<td>0.7327±0.0288</td>\n<td>0.8291±0.0228</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n## 3.4. Computational time\n\nThe proposed method takes around 20 minutes in average to complete the whole pipeline(including cortical thickness estimation and report generation). JLF method takes around 2 hours only for structure segmentations without cortical thickness estimation(excluding the preprocessing which includes several hours of non-linear registration depending on the number of atlases used). Freesurfer normally takes around 6 hours to perform the complete analysis(which also includes surface extraction).\n\n## 4. Discussion\n\nWe have presented a new pipeline for full brain segmentation(vol2Brain) that is able to segment the brain into 135 different regions in a very efficient and accurate manner. The proposed method also integrates these 135 regions to provide measures at different anatomical scales, including brain tissues and lobes. It also provides cortical thickness measurements per cortical structure and lobe displayed into an automatic report summarizing the results(see appendix).\n\nTo create vol2Brain pipeline we had to create a template library that integrates all the anatomical information needed to perform the labelling process. This was a long and laborious work since the original library obtained from Neuromorphometrics did not meet the required quality and we had to invest a significant amount of time to make it ready to use. To create this library, we homogenized the image resolution, orientation and size of the images, removed and relabeled inconsistent labels and corrected systematic labelling errors. Besides, we extended the labelling protocol adding external CSF and white matter lesions. As a result, we generated a highly consistent and high-quality library that not only allowed to develop the current proposed pipeline but will be also a valuable resource for future developments.\n\n"
